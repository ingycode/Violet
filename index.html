<h3>Parents:</h3>

<p>Violet is the eldest of four children. Her mother was a former adventuress who left to join an army at war when Violet was eight.</p>
<p class="sitat">“Daughter, we must find our duties in what comes to us, not in what we imagine might have been... or something.”</p>
<p class="forfatter">-Lenora Kimberley</p>
<p>Her father was a not-all-that-successful musician. He was a kind father, but did not provide all that much.</p>
<p class="sitat">“Violet, expect the best, prepare for the worst, and capitalise on what comes. Remember that, my girl.”</p>
<p class="forfatter">-Bennett Bonnington</p>
      <p>Violet learned to make her own money early on. As a child she was always in trouble with teachers and other adults, but had a talent for talking her way out.</p>
